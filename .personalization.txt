CHOICE POINT #1: COLOR THEME
Option Chosen: A
Explanation: I chose option A because I like the colors it already had. I think the colors of this theme look good together and they don't need any changing. Not changing the theme also makes it a lot easier for me which is nice. I also notice that the colors also give my site a finished look which I like.
