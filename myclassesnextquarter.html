           <p class="d-none d-sm-block"> I would want to take a painting class because I enjoy being creative and painting is a skill I want to develop. Taking a painting class would allow me to expiriment with how I like painting. Taking painting also would likely not give me homework for that class which is always nice.</p>

           <p class="d-none d-sm-block"> I only get half of this class because I still have take Language Arts (which is a half block for me) so I want a class that won't give me work. I think Choir is a fun class and could help me strengthen my voice. Choir is also a chill class that won't stress me out with tons of work every day.</p>

I feel that in Language Arts writing is one of my weakpoints so I want to strengthen my writing.
